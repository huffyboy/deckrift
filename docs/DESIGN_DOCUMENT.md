# Deckrift ‚Äì Drawn to Dust: Design Document

## Game Overview

**Deckrift ‚Äì Drawn to Dust** is a deck-based roguelike browser game where players explore a cursed realm through card-based encounters. The gameplay combines traditional card mechanics with persistent RPG progression and random events, encouraging replayability and strategic decision-making.

### Story

You were once an adventurer, until you vanished into a realm all your own. Immortal now, but utterly alone. No purpose. No subjects. No escape. You search, until madness paves a way.

### Core Concept

- **Deck-based roguelike gameplay** with persistent progression
- **Strategic decision-making** through card encounters
- **RPG elements** with stats, equipment, and upgrades
- **Responsive design** optimized for desktop and mobile
- **Local storage** for persistent game state and profiles

### Difficulty Scaling

- Each realm lasts 4 levels
- Every level or realm adds a difficulty/challenge modifier
- The challenge modifier makes each level harder and longer
- 5 overworld cards for each modifier
- Losing stat challenges or drawing banes give you banes/curses

## Overworld System

### Card Interaction Flow

The overworld card interaction follows a specific timing sequence:

1. **Card Selection**: Player clicks on adjacent card
2. **Card Reveal**: The card flips to reveal its content (player token remains on original position)
3. **Viewing Period**: Player sees the revealed card for 0.5-2 seconds
4. **Player Movement**: Player token moves to the revealed card location
5. **Movement Period**: Player sees their new position for 0.5-2 seconds
6. **Event Trigger**: The card's encounter (battle, challenge, shop, etc.) automatically triggers

This two-step timing sequence ensures players can clearly see:

- What card was revealed
- Where they moved to
- Before the encounter begins

### Map Generation

- Cards flipped upside down on the map
- Choose adjacent cards to progress to next location (flip and move token over)
- Board layout: columns of 5 with rows equal to the difficulty/challenge modifier
- Start in top left corner, joker (boss/exit) in bottom right corner
- Cards per level: 5 √ó challenge modifier

### Board Layout Examples

**Level 1 (Challenge Modifier 1)**: 1 row with player start and door

```text
üë§ [] [] [] [] [] üö™
```

**Level 3 (Challenge Modifier 3)**: 3 rows with player start and door

```text
üë§ [] [] [] [] []
    [] [] [] [] []
    [] [] [] [] [] üö™
```

**Level 4 (Challenge Modifier 4)**: 4 rows with player start and boss

```text
üë§ [] [] [] [] []
    [] [] [] [] []
    [] [] [] [] []
    [] [] [] [] [] üÉè
```

### Challenge Modifier Progression

- **Realm 1**: Levels 1-4 (Challenge Modifiers 1, 2, 3, 4)
- **Realm 2**: Levels 5-8 (Challenge Modifiers 2, 3, 4, 5)
- **Realm 3**: Levels 9-12 (Challenge Modifiers 3, 4, 5, 6)
- **Realm 4**: Levels 13-16 (Challenge Modifiers 4, 5, 6, 7)

### Card Distribution

- Shuffle and draw cards from standard 52 card deck (not player's deck)
- Place player token on a jocker card to the left of the top row (portal)
- Place another joker to the right of the bottome row (door or boss)
